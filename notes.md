## Ch. 1 Basics

Types of breakpoints in VS Code

* Breakpoint
* Conditional Breakpoint - you can write a conditional that evaluates to a boolean to the breakpoint so the breakpoint only executes if that condition is true
* Logpoint - (only supported for NodeJS and JS)
* Triggered Breakpoint

Run > Remove All Breakpoints

Many ways to see a variable's value while a breakpoint has paused execution (in VS Code):

* Locals panel
* Hover over the var name in the code 
* Type the var name into the debug console
* Add the var to the Watch panel
* Make function calls in the Debug Console
